\chapter{Preface}

This book explores the fascinating world of game-playing artificial intelligence through the lens of the Yolah game engine. From classical search algorithms to modern neural network approaches, we'll build a complete understanding of how computers can master complex games.

Throughout this journey, you'll discover:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How game-playing AI has evolved over decades
    \item Classical algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning
    \item Monte Carlo Tree Search and its applications
    \item Neural network evaluation functions
    \item Self-play training methodologies
    \item Performance optimization techniques
\end{itemize}

The code examples and algorithms presented here are based on real implementations in the Yolah engine, providing practical insights into building production-quality game AI.

% Creating a new chapter:
% 1. Create file: chapters/XX_chapter_name.tex
% 2. Start with: \chapter{Chapter Title}
% 3. Add sections, subsections, content
% 4. Uncomment the \include line above
%
% Example chapter structure:
%   \chapter{My Chapter}
%   \label{ch:mychapter}
%
%   \section{Introduction}
%   Content...

% Benefits of modular approach:
% - Easier collaboration (different people work on different chapters)
% - Better organization (each chapter is self-contained)
% - Faster compilation (can compile individual chapters)
% - Easier to reorder chapters
% - Better version control (smaller diffs)
%
% Compilation tips:
% - Full build: pdflatex --shell-escape book_modular.tex
% - Quick build: use \includeonly{chapters/05_minimax} to compile only one chapter
% - Use Makefile for automated builds
